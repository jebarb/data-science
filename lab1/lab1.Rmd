## Aviation Accidents and Fatalities, 1995-2014

This dataset is provided by the NTSB. Initially, it was poorly formatted and unusable, but since it is a small dataset, I was able to quickly manually clean up the data.

```{r}
datagov <- read.csv("table10_2014.csv")
summary(datagov)
head(datagov)
hours.lm = lm(All ~ Year + Flight.Hours, data = datagov)
summary(hours.lm)
plot(hours.lm, which = 1:2)

```

## Total accidents per year
Points sized by number of fatalities, alpha is flight hours per year

```{r}
ggplot(data = datagov) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Year, y = All, size = Total, alpha = Flight.Hours))
```
