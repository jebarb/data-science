Universities are typicall opaque, bureaucratic institutions. Many public schools such as the University of North Carolina system make [data about university employees publically](http://www.newsobserver.com/news/databases/public-salaries/) available. Using this dataset what can we learn about the dynamics of the university system?


## dplyr

To download the .Rmd file for this assignment go to the [github repo](https://github.com/idc9/stor390/tree/master/assignments/unc_depts), right click **und_depts.Rmd** and select *save link as*.

The best way to to learn the dplyr package is to just use it a lot. Read through the following dplyr tutorial the complete quetions in this .Rmd document. I suggest doing the coding in an R script then putting the answers into this documents.

- [dplyr flights vignettes](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html)

- chapter 5 ([data transformation](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html)) from r4ds

## Instructions
- please finish these questions by Tuesday, Jan 24. More questions will added then.
- use the `dplyr` functions to answer the following questions (base R will not be given credit) 
- submit just the .Rmd file to Sakai
- pay careful attention to the questions

- **return** something means just print it out. Similarly for questions **What is ...** just print out the answer

Q: Return the sum of the first 10 positive integers?

Q: What is the sum of the first 10 positive integers?
```{r}
sum(1:10)
```

- **create** or **save** means save a variable

Create a variable `x` with the sum of the first 10 positive integers.
```{r}
x <- sum(1:10)
```



# The data

First download the data set from Ryan Thornburg's website (it is also on stor390's github repo). You may want to set `cache=TRUE` for this chunk so you don't have to download the data set everytime you run the script.
```{r setup, message=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

# Load the UNC departments data
data <- read_csv(url("http://ryanthornburg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/UNC_Salares_NandO_2015-05-06.csv"))
```

Take a first look at the data
```{r}
colnames(data)

str(data)

head(data)
```

# Assignment


## Quesetion 1
Return a data frame with columns: name, dept, age,totalsal 
```{r}
data[,c("name", "dept", "age", "totalsal")]
```

Return a data frame with columns: statesal, nonstsal,totalsal using one of the `select_helpers` functions
```{r}
select(data, statesal, nonstsal, totalsal)
```

## Quesetion 2 
Rename the `fte` column to `fulltime`. Make sure this change is saved (i.e. `data <- ...`).
```{r}
data <- rename(data, fulltime = fte)
```

## Quesetion 3 

What is the mean salary in the Neurosurgery department?

```{r}
mean(filter(data, dept == "Neurosurgery")$totalsal)
```


Return a data frame with employee's in the Neurosurgery department making more than $500,000. Why might these professors be so well paid? 
```{r}
filter(data, dept == "Neurosurgery" & totalsal > 500000)
```



## Quesetion 4 
What is the total amount that full time Dermatology employees get paid?


```{r}
filter(data, dept == "Dermatology" & fulltime == 1)
```


## Quesetion 5

Create a data frame called radio_dept whose rows are the employees from the Radiology department. 

- include only the followig columns: name, position, age, nonstsal, salary. 
- order the employees by salary

First without chaining

```{r }
radio_dept <- filter(data, dept == "Radiology")
radio_dept <- select(radio_dept, name, position, age, nonstsal, totalsal)
radio_dept <- arrange(radio_dept, totalsal)
radio_dept
```


Next with chaining
```{r }
radio_dept <- arrange(
  select(
    filter(data, dept == "Radiology"), name, position, age, nonstsal, totalsal), totalsal)
radio_dept

```


Make a histogram of Radiology salaries
```{r }
ggplot(data = select(radio_dept, totalsal), 
       mapping = aes(x = totalsal)) + geom_histogram()
```


## Question 6

Use faceting to make totalsal histograms for Radiation Oncology, Radiology, Pediatrics, and Orthopaedics departments.
```{r }
ggplot(data = filter(data, 
                     dept == "Radiation Oncology" | 
                       dept == "Radiology" | 
                       dept == "Pediatrics" | 
                       dept == "Orthopaedics"), 
       mapping = aes(x = totalsal)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~dept)

```



Use faceting to make plot age vs. totalsal for the same four departments and color points position.
```{r }
ggplot(data = filter(data, 
                     dept == "Radiation Oncology" | 
                       dept == "Radiology" | 
                       dept == "Pediatrics" | 
                       dept == "Orthopaedics"), 
       mapping = aes(x = age, y = totalsal)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~dept)
```

## Question 7

Create a data frame called `dept_summary`  whose rows are the departments and  whose columns are: department size, mean department salary, median department salary, and maximum salary. 

```{r }
dept_summary <- group_by(data, dept)
dept_summary <- summarize(dept_summary, 
                          dept_size = n(),
                          mean_sal = mean(totalsal, na.rm = TRUE),
                          med_sal = median(totalsal, na.rm = TRUE),
                          max_sal = max(totalsal))
head(dept_summary)
summary(dept_summary)
colnames(dept_summary)
```


Order the departments by highest mean salary and print the 10 highest paid departments. 


```{r }
head(arrange(dept_summary, desc(mean_sal)), 10)
```

Order the departments by highest median salary and print the 10 highest paid departments. 

```{r }
head(arrange(dept_summary, desc(med_sal)), 10)
```

Why do these lists differ? If you were asked for the top 10 best paid departments at UNC which summary would you choose and why?

They differ because mean is the average and median is the middle of a group. Median salary will offer the best representation of pay rates of departments. The mean is more prone to being skewed and can offer a misrepresentation of salary data. The median, however, simply states half of employees make more and half less than this value, which makes it a more accurate representation of a typical salary.


## Question 8
How many departments have at least 10 employees?
```{r }
#
```


## Question 9
Which department hired the most people in 2010? Hint: you probably have to modify `hiredate`.
```{r }
#
```

## Question 10
Make a list of all the department names and sort this list alphabetically. What is the 42nd department in this list?
```{r }
#
```


## Question 11
Plot number of people hired by the CS dept per year vs. year
```{r }
#
```


Now add STOR, Math, Biostatistics, SILS and Physics to the above plot
```{r }
#
```


# Open question

Examine the relationship between age and salary at UNC. You can interpret this however you like e.g.

- age can mean number of years employed at the university
- compare and contrast different departments

Requirements

- hand in a separate .Rmd document 
    - load the data with read_csv(url(...)) like this script
- make 3 figures
    - a figure can be a visualization, print out of a data frame that you can created, the results of a statistical model/test (e.g. linear regression)
- display all code used
    - code should be commented
    - if you have a lot of functions you can put them in a separate .R script
- describe each figure
    - what is the figure (figure blah is a plot of foo vs. bar)
    - what is the upshot of the figure (figure blah shows that there is a strong relationship between foo and bar)
- write an explanation of your findings
    - a couple paragraphs
    - use proper grammar
    - your findings should be clear


# hints

- Read through the first dplyr tutorial. Every question can be answered using: filter, arrange, select, mutate, summarise and group_by functions.

- here are two more dplyr tutorials: https://rpubs.com/justmarkham/dplyr-tutorial and https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/home/week/3

- fte means full time employee
